Western music incorporates the same twelve tones over and over again, but there are many musical universes out there! Microtonal Explorer (MtX) is your guide to those universes. Easily create an equal-tempered scale with any number of tones and any arrangement of intervals, then experiment with your new scale, playing chords and riffs.

The edit mode lets you add and delete tones, then specify how many steps to place between each tone and the next. You are not limited to half steps and whole steps; try thirds, fifths, sevenths, whatever you like. MtX runs all the calculations for you immediately. At any point, flip over to play mode to test your scale. Six octaves are available, as well as several different instrument selections (more on the way!) 

Scales may be saved to your device and retrieved for later use. Standard major, minor, and pentatonic scales are already provided to get you started. Where will you go from here?
